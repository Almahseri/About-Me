        <h2>
        Introduction
        </h2>
        <p> 
        I am the second oldest in a family of five kids. I recently became an uncle and even more recently <br>
        gotten married to the woman of my dreams! I spend all of my free time either gaming or watching anime. <br>
        I am a senior majoring in Computer Science. I started off as an undecided student at UIC and took all my <br>
        gen-eds in those two years. I later decided that I wanted to become a pilot so I pursued a degree in <br>
        aviation at the University of Dubuque. That lasted about a year because of the insane amount it costs <br>
        to to become a pilot and I could never have afforded to stay on that path. I ended up taking two years off <br>
        of my education and I was working as a car salesman. I did not like it at all and decided I wanted to try <br>
        out Computer Science and thats where I am at today.

        <h2>
        What I Hope to Learn in this Course
        </h2>
        <p> I always wanted to learn more about creating applications and learning more about new languages. <br>
        A fiend of mine recently started a business of making websites for his clients as a side-gig and that <br>
        was very facinating how he cameup with that plan since he is an architect. The idea of having the abiility <br>
        and knowledge to be able to do something you love while also profiting from it felt like a nice way of life. <br>
        So far all I know about HTML is very limited but I would like to learn to make a website from scratch and <br>
        be able to own a known template that popular domain websites promote and earn residual income.
        </p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>Sprint 3 is all about making an interactive website so I thought that was cool.</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
        My Favorite Hobbies
        </h2>
        <p> 
        I am really into video games and I have been watching alot of anime since highschool. These to me are <br>
        what taking a hike or going to the gym is for others, it is a huge stress reliever and that is very important! <br>
        Believe it or not anime is not what you think it is. Alot of my friends and family refer to it as a kids cartoon <br>
        or that only kids should be watching it, but in reality alot of the shows are too gory, and the story lines are far <br>
        too complex for children to understand and follow along.
        <p>

        *Fun Fact*
        </h2>
        <p> 
        I am a PC enthusiast and I am the go-to guy for my friends and family to be able to get the parts and build the <br>
        PC of their dreams and also the one that matches their budget. If any of you guys are looking for a new rig <br>
        you can get in contact with me and I can do my best to make it work for you. (here is a few of them)
